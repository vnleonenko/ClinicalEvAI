    Task Instructions:
    1. Review the clinical trial paper, paying close attention to the sections discussing results related to the "{target_outcome}" for the defined cohort "{cohort}".
    2. Summarize the findings for each cohort, emphasizing the collective data and general trends observed. Individual patient data should only be mentioned if highlighted as a significant exception or case study in the paper.
    3. Present your summary in a table format with the following columns:
    - 'Group Name': Name of the cohort.
    - 'Number of Patients': Total participants in the cohort.
    - 'Specified Outcome Measure': Key findings and metrics related to the "{target_outcome}".
    Include aggregate values such as percentages, mean values, and other statistical summaries that reflect the overall results for the group.
    Must contain quantitative data, such as hazard ratios, odds ratios, mean differences, count of events, etc.
    Do not include qualitative or descriptive data that cannot be quantified, such as "statistically significant improvement" without specific values.

    Here are the definitions of some common outcome measurements:
    - overall survival/progression-free survival/etc.: usually defined by the hazard ratio or odds ratio, which is the ratio of hazard rate or odds of an event occurring in the treatment group to that in the control group.
        it can also be expressed as the number of events in the target group of patients.
    - toxicity/adverse events/etc.: defined by the rate of occurrence of adverse events in the target groups of patients.
    - objective response rate/overall response/etc.: defined by the proportion of patients who respond to the treatment in the target groups, or number of patients with complete or partial response.
    - disease control rate/relapse rate/etc.: defined by the proportion of patients who have stable disease or better in the target groups, or number of patients with disease control.
        it can also be expressed by the number of patients who have disease progression, so the disease control rate is 1 minus the progression rate.

def generate_continuous_elegant_python_code(inputs: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
    \"\"\"
    This function is used to generate python code to transform raw data into a structured format according to a specified schema.
    The raw data is collected from a clinical study paper and needs to be organized to facilitate a meta-analysis study.
    The target meta-analysis is driven by a specific research question, defined by the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) elements.

    The function takes a dictionary of `inputs` as an argument, which contains the following keys:
    - 'research_question': contains the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) elements of the targeted meta-analysis.
        Based on the research question's intervention and comparator, you need to classify which arms in the raw data belong to the targeted
        experimental and control groups.
        Based on the research question's population, you need to consider which parts of the observations in the raw data are relevant to the targeted meta-analysis.
    - 'raw_data': this is the markdown formatted input dataframe that contains the raw data to be transformed.
    - 'desc': the description of the target dataframe the generated code needs to produce.
    - 'target_output': the generated code needs produce a dataframe follows the structure of this target_output.

    IMPORTANT: 'raw_data' does **NOT** need to be parsed or loaded into a dataframe. In your generated code,
        just use `df` to represent the dataframe that contains the raw data.

    IMPORTANT: NaN values should be treated with caution. If the raw data contains NaN values, ensure that your code handles them appropriately,
        either by removing the row with any NaN values or by filling all NaN with zeros.

    IMPORTANT: Never use `pd.DataFrame.append` to add data to pd.DataFrame. This method has been deprecated, and it is recommended to use `pd.concat` instead.
        For example, to add a new row to a dataframe, you can use `df = pd.concat([df, new_row], ignore_index=True)`
        Never use `df.append(new_row, ignore_index=True)`
    
    The function returns a string of raw Python code, wrapped within <code> and </code> tags. For example:
    <code>
    # df
    # Your generated python code here...

    # df = ...

    def classify_arms(df: pd.DataFrame):
        # you need to define a new column in the dataframe to indicate which group each arm belongs to
        # each arm should be classified as either experimental or control

Task Instructions:
1. Review the clinical trial paper, paying close attention to the sections discussing results related to the "{target_outcome}" for the defined cohorts.
2. Summarize the findings for each cohort, emphasizing the collective data and general trends observed. Individual patient data should only be mentioned if highlighted as a significant exception or case study in the paper.
3. Present your summary in a table format with the following columns:
   - 'Group Name': Name of the cohort.
   - 'Number of Patients': Total participants in the cohort.
   - 'Specified Outcome Measure': Key findings and metrics related to the "{target_outcome}".
      Include aggregate values such as percentages, mean values, and other statistical summaries that reflect the overall results for the group. 
      Mention individual patient data only if it's highlighted as a significant part of the study's findings.

Note: Your analysis should focus on the aggregate data and main conclusions drawn for each group, ensuring a concise and clear presentation of the trial's outcomes.

Note: Do not include group that does not have numerical or quantifiable outcomes reported.

Given a clinical study paper containing raw data on various arms of a trial, your task is to transform this data into a standard structured table format. 

The data extraction should be guided by a specific research question, defined by the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) elements. 

**Input Data:**
```
{results}
```

**Research Question:**
1. Population (P): {population}
2. Intervention (I): {intervention}
3. Comparator (C): {comparator}
4. Outcome (O): {outcome}

**Instructions:**

**Step 1:** Identify Key Study Arms
- Start by reviewing the research question, paying close attention to the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) elements.
- From the raw study data, pinpoint the study arms that directly relate to the specified Intervention and Comparator. These will be the focus of your analysis.

**Step 2:** Data Extraction and Consolidation
- Carefully extract relevant data from the identified study arms. Pay special attention to details such as number of participants, outcome values, and other pertinent outcome metrics that are crucial for the target meta-analysis.
- If multiple entries pertain to the same intervention, merge their data into one row to represent the experimental group. If there are separate interventions and comparators, allocate two rows: one for the experimental group and one for the comparator group.
- For unknown but important information such as participant numbers (N), you may need to deduce the figure from descriptive text. 
    For instance, if the raw data mentions "Four of seven patients achieved...", interpret this as "N": 7. Convert such textual descriptions into numerical data wherever possible.
    If the raw data describes the individual outcomes of participants, summarize these outcomes to obtain the total number of participants and the overall outcome value for each arm.

**Step 3:** Structuring the Data into a Table
- Organize the extracted data into a structured table format. Ensure that each column represents a crucial numerical data point necessary for meta-analysis. This may include participant numbers (N), measurable outcomes, and other quantifiable metrics related to the intervention or comparator.
- Classify each arm as belonging to the experimental or control group, which is important for subsequent meta-analysis.
- All columns must contain numerical data that is pertinent to the PICO-driven research question. This is essential for the subsequent meta-analysis.
- Assign clear and concise headings to each column to reflect the data it contains. The table should be formatted consistently to facilitate easy interpretation and analysis.
